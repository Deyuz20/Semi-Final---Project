<h2>iPhone 14 Pro Max</h2>

<p>Meet Dynamic Island.</p>

<div>Dynamic Island bubbles up music, sports scores, phone calls, and so much more — without taking you away from what you’re doing.

You can touch and hold to control your music, view the battery life of your AirPods, and more.

It’s integrated throughout iOS — and works with lots of different apps — to seamlessly surface what you need, right when you need it.

The advanced quad-pixel sensor on the Main camera makes the most of 48 megapixels by adapting to what you’re shooting.</div>
