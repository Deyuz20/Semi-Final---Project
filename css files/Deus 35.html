<p>The Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci.
 Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance, it has been described as "the best known,
 the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world".
 In comparison to many contemporary images of the elite, this portrait is stripped of the usual trappings of high status or symbolic hints to the sitter's dynastic heritage.
 All attention is thus drawn to her face, and that enigmatic expression.</p>
